    "```{Random Forest} Summary  \n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:** Random Forest Classifier is a versatile and powerful machine learning model widely used for both classification and regression tasks. It belongs to the ensemble learning family, meaning it combines the predictions of multiple individual models to improve overall performance. In the case of Random Forest, these individual models are decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensemble Learning:**\n",
    "Think of ensemble learning as a group of experts making predictions. Each expert (decision tree in this case) has its strengths and weaknesses, and the ensemble combines their opinions to create a more accurate and robust prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Tree:**\n",
    "A decision tree is like a flowchart where each internal node represents a decision based on a particular feature, each branch represents the outcome of the decision, and each leaf node represents the final predicted class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:** \n",
    "Ask yourself: Are more models better than fewer models? \n",
    "Think of it as a voting system where each decision tree gets one vote. The final decision is the majority vote, making it more reliable than relying on a single decision tree.Random Forest operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) of the individual trees.To create diversity among the trees, Random Forest uses a technique called bootstrapped sampling. It constructs each tree using a random subset of the training data, allowing each tree to see a slightly different perspective of the overall dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation:** \n",
    "Random Forest has several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robustness:** It is less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees, making it more robust for a variety of datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Importance:** It provides insights into the most critical features for making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Versatility:** It can handle both classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it might not be the best choice for real-time applications due to its training time, and the interpretation of individual trees can be complex.\n",
